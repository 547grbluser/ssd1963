Abstract
~~~~~~~~
SSD1963 is a user-space driver library for the so-named display controller chip
by Solomon Systech.

It provides functions to initialize and control the Framebuffer on that chip as
well as setting up frequencies, display timings and the bus from the controller
to the LCD.

About the controller
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SSD1963 is an LCD controller with an inbuilt framebuffer of 1215 KiB to
hold the RGB values for each pixel. It supports quite a set of commands that
allow to easily manipulate what's shown on the LCD without changing the actual
data in the framebuffer.

This library provides access to all the documenten commands the controller
supports.
